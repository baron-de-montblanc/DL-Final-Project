# Spring 2024 Deep Learning Final Project

### Goal: Transfer Learning for Jet Physics

#### Requirements

The GitHub repo comes with a reduced dataset (```reduced_atlas_dataset.h5```), for the purpose of getting familiar with the data. However, one will eventually have to download the full-size data from [the CERN website](https://opendata.cern.ch/record/15013).

#### Structure

All structural code is stored in appropriate ```.py``` files. However, for a more comfortable user experience, we provide a Jupyter Notebook where the data will be accessed, the models will be trained, and the main results of this project will be presented.
